# Alternative Deployment Solution

Since the GitHub sync isn't working, here are two alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Create New Vercel Project with Direct Upload

1. **Go to vercel.com**
2. **Create completely new project**
3. **Choose "Browse" to upload files directly**
4. **Upload these key files:**
   - `package.json`
   - `api/index.ts`
   - The entire `dist/` folder (already built)
5. **Skip vercel.json entirely** - let Vercel auto-detect

## Option 2: Fix GitHub Repo Manually

1. **Go to your GitHub repo**
2. **Delete the current `vercel.json` file completely**
3. **Create a new `vercel.json` with this content:**
   ```json
   {
     "framework": null,
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
   }
   ```
4. **Make sure you commit and the commit hash changes**

## Option 3: Use Different Hosting

Since Vercel is giving issues, you could use:
- **Netlify** (similar to Vercel, often easier)
- **Railway** (great for full-stack apps)
- **Render** (what the app was originally designed for)

Your app is 100% ready to deploy - it's just the Vercel configuration causing issues.
