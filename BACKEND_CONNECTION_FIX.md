# Backend Connection Issues - Diagnosis & Fix

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment frontend is working, but the backend API isn't connecting to your Supabase database properly. This means:
- Frontend loads but shows no messages
- API calls are failing or returning empty results
- Database environment variable may not be set correctly

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is exactly:
     ```
     postgresql://postgres.aqghdmrogzudqosisvan:010508ZEKE@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
     ```

2. **Test API Endpoints:**
   Visit these URLs in your browser to test:
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/recipients`
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/messages/public`

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Set
**Solution:** Add the DATABASE_URL in Vercel project settings

### Issue 2: API Routes Not Working
**Solution:** Ensure your `api/index.ts` file was uploaded correctly

### Issue 3: Database Connection Failed
**Solution:** Verify the Supabase connection string is exactly correct

## Expected Results
When working properly, the API should return:
- `/api/recipients`: `["Admin"]`
- `/api/messages/public`: Array of message objects including your test messages

Let's verify which specific issue you're facing.
