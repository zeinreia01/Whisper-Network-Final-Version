# Git-Based Deployment (Recommended)

Perfect choice! Since your files are already pushed to GitHub, this is the cleanest approach.

## Step 1: Connect GitHub to Vercel

1. **Go to vercel.com**
2. **Sign in with your GitHub account** (the new one with the repo)
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Import Git Repository"**
5. **Choose your `whisper-network` repository**

## Step 2: Configure the Project

1. **Framework Preset**: Select "Other" or "Vite"
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
3. **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
4. **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Step 3: Environment Variables

Add this in the Environment Variables section:
```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://postgres.aqghdmrogzudqosisvan:010508ZEKE@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

## Step 4: Deploy

Click "Deploy" - Vercel will:
- Clone your repo
- Install dependencies
- Run the build
- Deploy both frontend and API

## Why This Works Better

- No problematic `vercel.json` file needed
- Vercel auto-detects the configuration
- Continuous deployment from GitHub
- Easier to manage updates

Your app should deploy successfully within 2-3 minutes!
