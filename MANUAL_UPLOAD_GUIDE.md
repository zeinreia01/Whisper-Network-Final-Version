# Manual Upload to Vercel (Fastest Solution)

Since GitHub sync is having issues, let's bypass it completely:

## Step 1: Download These Files from Replit

Download these essential files to your phone:
1. `package.json`
2. `api/index.ts` 
3. The entire `dist/` folder
4. `shared/` folder

## Step 2: Create New Vercel Project

1. Go to **vercel.com**
2. Click "**New Project**"
3. Choose "**Browse**" (not GitHub import)
4. Upload the files above

## Step 3: Configure

1. **Framework**: Select "Other"
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
3. **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your Supabase connection string

## Why This Will Work

- Your app is already built (the `dist/` folder)
- The API function is ready (`api/index.ts`)
- No problematic `vercel.json` to cause issues
- Vercel will auto-detect the setup

This bypasses all the configuration issues and should deploy successfully in minutes.
