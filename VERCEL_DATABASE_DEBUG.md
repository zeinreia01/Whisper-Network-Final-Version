# Vercel Database Connection Fix

## The Issue
Your local development works perfectly (I can see the messages in the logs), but Vercel isn't connecting to your Supabase database. This is a common deployment issue.

## Immediate Fix Steps

### 1. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
Go to your Vercel project dashboard:
1. Click on your project
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Click "Environment Variables"
4. Make sure you have exactly:
   ```
   Name: DATABASE_URL
   Value: postgresql://postgres.aqghdmrogzudqosisvan:010508ZEKE@aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```
5. **Important**: Make sure it's set for "Production" environment

### 2. Test Your Live API
Visit these URLs directly in your browser:
- `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/recipients`
- `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/messages/public`

Expected results:
- Recipients should show: `["Admin"]`
- Messages should show your test messages array

### 3. Check Vercel Function Logs
In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to "Functions" tab
2. Look for any error logs
3. Check if there are database connection errors

## Most Likely Solutions

**If API returns empty arrays**: Environment variable isn't set properly
**If API returns 500 errors**: Database connection string is wrong
**If API doesn't respond**: The serverless function isn't deploying correctly

## Quick Test
Share your Vercel app URL with me, and I can help verify which specific issue you're facing.

Your local app works perfectly, so this is purely a deployment configuration issue.
