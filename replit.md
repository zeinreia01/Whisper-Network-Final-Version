## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL (Render-compatible)
- **API Style**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Authentication**: Bcrypt password hashing, separate user/admin systems

### Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend application
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and database schema

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Anonymous user accounts with unique usernames (no email required)
- **Messages Table**: Stores user messages with content, category, optional Spotify links, and public/private visibility
- **Replies Table**: Stores replies to messages with content and nickname (threaded comments)
- **Admins Table**: Admin accounts with display names for recipient options, special ZEKE001 account
- **Relations**: One-to-many relationships between users/messages/replies

### Frontend Components
- **Landing Page**: Welcome screen with local storage-based first visit tracking
- **Home Page**: Message creation form with category selection
- **Dashboard**: Public message display with filtering capabilities
- **Admin Panel**: Private message management interface
- **Message Cards**: Reusable components for displaying messages and replies
- **Category Filter**: Dynamic filtering system for message categories
- **Accessibility Menu**: Built-in accessibility features

### Backend Services
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted database operations with interface-based design
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful endpoints for messages and replies
- **Database Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Data Flow

1. **Message Creation**: Users create messages through the home page form, selecting categories and optional Spotify links
2. **Public/Private Flow**: Messages can be created as public (immediately visible) or private (admin review required)
3. **Reply System**: Users can reply to public messages with nicknames
4. **Admin Management**: Admins can view private messages and make them public
5. **Real-time Updates**: React Query handles automatic refetching and cache invalidation

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI components for accessibility
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **zod**: Runtime type validation and schema validation

### Development Tools

- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting

### Database Tools
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store for Express

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
- Backend builds to `dist/` using esbuild with Node.js targeting
- Single deployment artifact containing both client and server

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for Neon PostgreSQL
- **Development**: Uses `NODE_ENV=development` for local development
- **Production**: Uses `NODE_ENV=production` for optimized builds

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend with hot reloading
- **Database Management**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes to database
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript across the entire project
- **Categories**: Anything, Love, Advice, Confession, Rant, Reflection, Writing (with color coding)

### Production Considerations
- Static file serving for the React frontend
- API routes prefixed with `/api/`
- Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit
- Environment-specific configuration for database connections
